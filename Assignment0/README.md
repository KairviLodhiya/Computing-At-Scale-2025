# Matrix-Vector Product Implementation

This project implements a C++ function to compute the product of a dense matrix with a matrix or a vector. It includes separate files for the implementation, a test suite, and a build system using `make`.

## File Structure

- **header.hpp**: Header file with the function declarations.
- **matrixVectorProduct.cpp**: Implementation file with the function definition to multiply a vector and a matrix.
- **matrixMatrixProduct.cpp**: Implementation file with the function definition to multiply a matrix and a matrix.
- **mmio.h**: Header file to read and write Matrix Market files.
- **mmio.c**: Function file to read and write Matrix Market files.
- **testScript.cpp**: Testing files for checking the answer.
- **Makefile**: Build system for compiling and testing the project.
